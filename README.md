## Q Characteristics
### Leakage Current
For NPN and PNP bipolar junction transistors, one of the xsistor's DC operating-point characteristics is the current
that flows between the emitter and collector when the base-junction is open.
See file `Q_characteristics/leakage_current/leakage_current_02.asc` for DC-sweep.
